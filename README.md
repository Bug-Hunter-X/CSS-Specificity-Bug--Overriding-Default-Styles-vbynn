# CSS Specificity Bug
This repository demonstrates a common CSS bug related to specificity.  The `bug.css` file contains a CSS rule that fails to override a default browser style or a higher-specificity parent rule due to insufficient selector precision.
The `bugSolution.css` file shows how to fix this by using more precise selectors or by adjusting the CSS rule order.
