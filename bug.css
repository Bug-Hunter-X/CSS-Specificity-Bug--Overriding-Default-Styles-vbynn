The CSS specificity is too low to override the default styles.  This often happens when using !important, but there's a more subtle issue:  styles applied through the browser's default stylesheets or a parent element have higher specificity than your selector.  For example, the default styling applied to elements like `<p>` tags can override your styles unless you're precise enough with your selectors.
