To solve this, you need to increase the specificity of your CSS selector. This can be done in several ways:

1. **Increase Selector Specificity:** Add more identifiers to your selector.  For example, instead of `p { color: blue; }`, you might use `#myParagraph p { color: blue; }` or `.myClass p { color: blue; }` or `article p { color: blue; }`.  The more specific your selector, the higher its weight.

2. **Use `!important` (With Caution):**  As a last resort, you can use `!important` to override other styles. However, overuse of `!important` can make your CSS harder to maintain.  Use this only when absolutely necessary.

3. **CSS Order:**  The later a rule appears in your CSS, the higher the priority (if other factors are equal). In other words, ensure your overriding rule is placed later in your stylesheet. 

Example of a fix (replace with your actual selector):

```css
/* Instead of this (low specificity) */
p { color: blue; }

/* Use this (higher specificity) */
#my-paragraph p { color: blue; }
```
